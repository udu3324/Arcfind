## About
Arcfind is an application that finds a string in a directory. It can also find it in subdirectories and specific archive types like Jars, Gzip, 7z, and Zip. This is super useful for searching in a log directory with tons of archived logs.

**UI**     
The UI of Arcfind is made with javafx and is simple to use.

## Installation
Make sure you have [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and above installed to run Arcfind.       
You can download the runnable jar [here](https://github.com/udu3324/Arcfind/releases/latest).     There will be a tempStorage directory created to store extracted archives on start. (ignore it) It will automatically be deleted after Arcfind is closed.
